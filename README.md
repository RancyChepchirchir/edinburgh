This represents a small sample work from the [MSc in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees?id=107&r=site/view) program at the **University of Edinburgh** (2017 class).

Below are the courses I took in the program, along with some info about the course and what kind of material is included in this repo.

I use Python in all courses except for Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition (where I used MATLAB), Introduction to Java Programming (where I used Java), and Human Computer Interaction (where I used some Javasript).
