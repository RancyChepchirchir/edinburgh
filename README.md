This represents a small sample of my papers from the **MSc in Artificial Intelligence** program at the **University of Edinburgh**, from which I graduated in 2017. **Only a small bit of code is included** in this repository. I use Python in all courses except for Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition (where I used MATLAB), Introduction to Java Programming (where I used Java), and Human Computer Interaction (where I used some Javasript).

My **thesis is in a separate repository** called "thesis".
