/**
 * Class World - main data class.
 * 
 * Creates the world and manages the all data related to the locations,
 * connections between locations, the current location of the user, the current
 * orientation of the user (i.e., the direction the user is facing), the pick-up
 * items available at the current location, and the userâ€™s inventory items. When
 * the user initiates the Forward command, the current location in the world is
 * changed while the orientation remains the same. Conversely, if the user
 * initiates the Left or Right commands, the orientation is updated while the
 * current location remains the same.
 * 
 * Orientation is modeled as a cyclical variable from 0 to 3, where each
 * increase in 1 modulo 4 (e.g., 0 to 1, or 3 to 0) represents a clockwise turn.
 * Orientation is used in conjunction with Location methods to establish
 * movement between locations and to identify the main image to display for the
 * current location.
